## Overview
The [**20-501-34_R3_Disco_Innovation_Sheet.pdf**](20-501-34_R3_Disco_Innovation_Sheet.pdf) file in this repository provides an overview of the @DisCo softawre.

### Additional Information
@DisCo was developed at Idaho National Laboratory for the DOE-CESER-CEDS funded Firmware Indicator Translation (FIT) project. The FIT project seeks to provide scalable tools for novel and efficient binary analysis. FIT currently uses @DisCo with advanced machine learning techniques to minimize reverse engineering efforts.

The @DisCo application is also being utilized by other DOE projects, Geo Threat Observables (GTO), Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium (GMLC), Firmware Command and Control, and Deep Learning Malware.
